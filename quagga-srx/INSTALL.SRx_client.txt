Building and Installing Quagga SRx client:


Configuration Option:
    --disable-srx     	    Do not compile the SRx extension. In this mode 
                            QuaggaSRx compiles as pure Quagga router without
                            RPKI and BGPSEC integration.
    --enable-srxcryptoapi   to have the srxcryptoapi library to take care of
                            verifying/signing functions


Compile:
    For compiling Quagga bgp module with SRx client which is able to connect
    SRx server,

    1. copy "srx" directory which is located in "include" directory of SRx server.
	that is, "<SRx installed dir>/include/srx"
	
	or,

  Might be specified with environment variables:
 	      CPPFLAGS = -I<SRx installed dir>/include/
	      SRX_USER_INC = <SRx installed dir>/include/

         (It can also be used as a default directory of the openssl installation)
        CRYPTOAPI_DIR = <srxcryptoapi installed dir>

    2. paste into the quagga-<ver>.
    3. run configure with configuration option.
    4. make all install
    

 (Configuration example)
#1 Simple version (in case the SRxServer rpm version is already installed)
./configure --prefix=<desired dir> --disable-ospfapi --disable-ospfd --disable-ospf6d --disable-babeld --enable-user=root --enable-group=root --enable-configfile-mask=0644 --enable-logfile-mask=0644 --enable-srxcryptoapi

#2 With all switches (in case of installing the source tarball)
./configure --prefix=<desired dir> --disable-ospfapi --disable-ospfd --disable-ospf6d --disable-babeld --enable-user=root --enable-group=root --enable-configfile-mask=0644 --enable-logfile-mask=0644 --enable-srxcryptoapi srx_dir=<srx-installed dir> sca_dir=<srxcryptoapi-installed dir>


Key Management and Installation for this Version
-----------------------------------------------------------

Current Features:
- Single private key, no key rollover
- Certificates and keys are self signed, stored on HDD (must be generated using
  the provided qsrx-make tools)
- Partial integration of QuaggaSRx and SRx server (BGPSEC currently within
  QuaggaSRx)
- BGPSEC for read/write, no selective configuration yet
- BGPSEC per peering session

Configuration:
==================
The current configuration has three parameters:
bgpsec ski <key-ski>                   : Private key
neighbor A.B.C.D bgpsec (snd|rec|both) : This session performs BGPSEC
srx evaluation bgpsec                  : Use bgpsec path validation result in 
                                         update validation
