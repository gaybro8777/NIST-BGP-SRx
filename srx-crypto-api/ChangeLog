===========================================================

Version 0.1.2.1 - January-March 2016
  - Added init method (missing in 0.1.2.0)
  - Fixed bugs
Version 0.1.2.0 - September-December 2015
  - Moved the installed libraries into lib/srx or lib64/srx. Same for the header
    file srxcryptoapi.h - It is not located in srx/srxcryptoapi.h
  - Changed --enable settings (testlib and bgpsec-openssl) to be --without 
    settings. Components are installed by default.
  - Added --without-la-lib which is used for RPM generation. This setting is 
    used in spec file %configure statement to not include .a and .la libraries
    in rpm file.
  _ Restructured initialization code
  - Removed term_debug and added sca_getCurrentLogLevel
  - Added configuration for key file extension for backwards compatibility
  - Modified the key generation to not only produce the PEM encoded key.
    Newly der encoded keys are stores and xxxxx.der
  - Use the DER encoded key rather than the PEM encoded one.
  - Added key storage to BGPSecOpenSSL implementation.
  - The verify and sign methods now take the DER encoded keys.
  _ Added functionality to NOT load functions the plugin reports as not 
    supported - regardless if they are configured or not.
    Example: !isExtended -> extValidate and all public key functions are not 
                            loaded
  - Modified the qsrx-xxx tools to only install keys not already installed.
    Kept backwards compatibility with key filenames. PEM=.key, DER=.der
    The PEM keys are used for srxCryptoAPI 0.1.1.1, all others will use the
    DER encoding.
