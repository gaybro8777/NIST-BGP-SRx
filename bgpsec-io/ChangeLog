Version 0.2.0.10
  * Updated the spec file to require SCA >=0.2.0 and SCA < 0.3.0
  * Fixed some issues with configuration relating to SCA library
Version 0.2.0.9
  * Fixed printer output for non transitive attributes by adding the output 
    string "Non-transitive"
Version 0.2.0.8
  * Modified the valies of BGP_CAP_T_BGPSEC and BGP_UPD_A_TYPE_BGPSEC to
    the IANA assigned values. 
    For backwards compatibility with code written during the time where IANA did
    not have the values assigned yet, these values still can be modified during 
    compile time to other values using -DBGP_CAP_T_BGPSEC=<num> etc.
Version 0.2.0.7
  * Added define CREATE_TESTVECTOR to allow easy generation of a test vector
    printout as it is done for draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs-17
  * Modified k for BIO-K1 to use the k as advertised.
  * Added flow control if peer cannot keep up with the packets BIO slows down
    sending.
  * Added code to generate BGP4 updates if bgpsec is not negotiated for the 
    particular update type (IPv4/IPv6). This only applies to updates that are 
    generated "on the fly". Pre-stored updates still are send regardless of the
    negotiation.
  * Removed default disabling of BGPsec IPv6 Sending capability.
  * Enhanced Notification printer to include Capabilities being printed for
    'Unsupported Capabilities' Notification message.
  * Added missing capabilities to 'Unsupported Capability' notification.
  * Added missing portions of detailed OPEN message in printer.
  * Added script bio-traffic.sh for large update generation.
  * Added more info to error message for invalid scripted update messages.
  * Fixed IPv6 handling
  * Added CFLAGS parameter to allow printing digest and signature during
    signing operation. This switch might be replaced with a configuration
    setting in future versions.
  * Added CFLAGS attributes BGP_CAP_T_BGPSEC and BGP_UPD_A_TYPE_BGPSEC to
    allow setting these IANA assigned values during configuration / compile
    time. These switches are temporary.
Version 0.2.0.6
  * Added extended message capability
Version 0.2.0.5
  * Added configuration of bgpsec capabilities.
  * Added missing capability exchange for extended BGP messages (>4096) bytes
    as specified in draft-ietf-idr-extended-messages
  * Added capability to specify K for generating signatures using ECDSA
  * Added capability to specify if the BGP Path Attribute should use a one byte
    length field or if the length field should be 2 byte (3xtended length). 
    For this the parameter only_extended_length (default: true) is added to the
    configuration file. 
  * Fixed BUG in printing received bgpsec path attributes where the path 
    attributes length field is only one byte of size.
Version 0.2.0.0
  * Increased BGPSEC_IO_RECORD_VERSION to 1
  * Added draft parameter to stored record.
  * Added proper handling of CEASE notifications during OpenSent
  * Added capability to specify customized configuration for SRxCryptoAPI
  * Changed configuration file parameter from -c to -f. This prevents 
    accidentally overwriting of cofiguration file when using -C (upper case)
  * Moved capi initialization and management into CAPI processing mode.
  * Added Notification Cease Codes (RFC 4486)
  * Modified the holdtimer to allow immediate shutdown of a session in case a 
    notification is received.
